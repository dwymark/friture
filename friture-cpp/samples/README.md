# Friture C++ - Sample Spectrogram Images

This directory contains sample spectrogram images generated by the Friture C++ integration pipeline test. These images demonstrate the complete signal processing chain:

**Pipeline:** Synthetic Audio → FFT Processing → Frequency Resampling → Color Transform → Spectrogram Image

## Image Specifications

- **Dimensions:** 800×400 pixels
- **Format:** 32-bit BMP (RGBA)
- **Colormap:** CMRMAP (black→purple→red→yellow→white)
- **FFT Size:** 2048 samples
- **Sample Rate:** 48 kHz
- **Duration:** 2 seconds of audio per image

## Sample Images

### 1. Pure Sine Wave (1 kHz)
**File:** `01_sine_1khz_linear.bmp`

**Description:** A pure 1 kHz sine wave displayed on a linear frequency scale. You should see a single horizontal line at 1 kHz.

**Technical Details:**
- Signal: sin(2π × 1000 × t)
- Frequency Scale: Linear
- Expected Result: Bright horizontal line at 1000 Hz

---

### 2. Linear Chirp (100 Hz → 10 kHz)
**File:** `02_chirp_linear.bmp`

**Description:** A frequency sweep from 100 Hz to 10 kHz over 2 seconds, displayed on linear scale. Shows a diagonal line rising from bottom to top.

**Technical Details:**
- Signal: Frequency ramp from 100 to 10,000 Hz
- Frequency Scale: Linear
- Expected Result: Diagonal line with constant slope

---

### 3. Chirp on Mel Scale
**File:** `03_chirp_mel.bmp`

**Description:** Same chirp as above, but displayed on Mel scale (perceptually linear for human hearing). The slope appears steeper at high frequencies.

**Technical Details:**
- Signal: Same frequency ramp 100 → 10,000 Hz
- Frequency Scale: Mel (perceptually motivated)
- Expected Result: Curved diagonal (steeper at high freqs)

---

### 4. Harmonic Series (440 Hz)
**File:** `04_harmonics_440hz.bmp`

**Description:** Musical note A4 (440 Hz) with 8 harmonics. Shows the fundamental frequency plus overtones at integer multiples.

**Technical Details:**
- Fundamental: 440 Hz (A4)
- Harmonics: 440, 880, 1320, 1760, 2200, 2640, 3080, 3520 Hz
- Frequency Scale: Linear
- Expected Result: Multiple horizontal lines with decreasing brightness

---

### 5. FM Synthesis
**File:** `05_fm_synthesis.bmp`

**Description:** Frequency-modulated signal (carrier: 2 kHz, modulator: 5 Hz, depth: 500 Hz). Demonstrates time-varying frequency content.

**Technical Details:**
- Carrier Frequency: 2000 Hz
- Modulation Frequency: 5 Hz
- Modulation Depth: ±500 Hz
- Frequency Scale: Linear
- Expected Result: Wavy horizontal band around 2 kHz

---

### 6. White Noise
**File:** `06_white_noise.bmp`

**Description:** Random white noise with uniform distribution across all frequencies. Should show consistent energy across the entire spectrum.

**Technical Details:**
- Signal: Uniformly distributed random samples
- Amplitude: 0.2 (20% of full scale)
- Frequency Scale: Linear
- Expected Result: Uniform brightness across all frequencies

---

### 7. Chirp on Logarithmic Scale
**File:** `07_chirp_log.bmp`

**Description:** Same linear chirp displayed on logarithmic frequency scale. Equal frequency ratios occupy equal vertical space.

**Technical Details:**
- Signal: Linear frequency ramp 100 → 10,000 Hz
- Frequency Scale: Logarithmic (base 10)
- Expected Result: Curved diagonal (concave upward)

---

### 8. C Major Scale
**File:** `08_c_major_scale.bmp`

**Description:** Eight notes of the C major scale (C4-C5) played sequentially. Shows discrete frequency jumps over time.

**Technical Details:**
- Notes: C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, B4, C5
- Frequencies: 261.63, 293.66, 329.63, 349.23, 392.00, 440.00, 493.88, 523.25 Hz
- Frequency Scale: Linear
- Expected Result: Stepped pattern with 8 horizontal segments

---

## How to Interpret

**X-Axis (Horizontal):** Time (left = start, right = end)
**Y-Axis (Vertical):** Frequency (bottom = low, top = high)
**Color:** Amplitude/Intensity
  - Black: Very quiet (< -100 dB)
  - Purple/Red: Moderate energy
  - Yellow/White: High energy

## Regenerating Images

To regenerate these images, run the pipeline integration test:

```bash
cd friture-cpp/build
./examples/pipeline_test
```

Images will be created in the `build/output/` directory.

## Technical Validation

These images serve multiple purposes:

1. **Visual Verification:** Confirm that the signal processing pipeline produces correct results
2. **Algorithm Testing:** Validate FFT, frequency resampling, and color mapping
3. **Performance Demonstration:** Show real-time capable processing (all images generated in <5 seconds)
4. **Documentation:** Provide visual examples of different audio signals and frequency scales
